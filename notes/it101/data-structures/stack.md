# Stack (LIFO)
- maintains order
- fast insert/delete `O(1)` (push/pop)
- no access by index
- used for **depth-first search**, _backtracking_, expression evaluation, reversing, browser history
- implemented by array or linked list

## Tips & Tricks
- pushing onto and then popping from a stack reverses the order
- stack can be used for eliminating "dead" options (find celebrity challenge, find next greater element in an array, ...)
