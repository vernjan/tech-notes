# P, NP and NP-Complete problems
- `P` - polynomial, problems can be quickly solved (and verified)
- `NP` - nondeterministic polynomial time, given a solution, the solution can be quickly verified
- Does `P = NP`? Probably no, no-one knows for sure. It's one of the big open math questions.

## NP examples
- travelling salesperson
- covering sets
- finding cliques in graphs
- graph coloring
