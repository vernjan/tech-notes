# Machine learning

## K-nearest neighbors
- **rule of thumb** - look at `sqrt(N)` of neighbors (`N` is total number of users/items)

### Usage
- **classification** - categorization into groups
- **regression** - predicting a response (like a number)

### Cosine similarity
- doesn't measure distance but compares angles
