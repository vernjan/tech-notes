# Greedy Algorithms
- problem-solving _heuristic_ of making the locally optimal choice at each stage
- in other words - greedy algorithms optimize locally, _hoping_ to end up with a global optimum
- greedy algorithms are usually easy but **don't always give optimal solutions!**
- **examples**
    - knapsack problem - take the most valuable objects first
    - shortest path - go to the nearest city
    - change machine - greedy approach gives optimal solution
