# Linear programming

- optimization technique for finding the best outcome in a given mathematical model (finds a min or max)
- used for resource allocation, production planning, scheduling, etc.
- **MILP** (mixed-integer linear programming)
  - coefficients and variables are integers - if we cannot split a resource into smaller pieces
  - LP - variables are continuous (water, electricity)
  - MILP - variables are integers (people, machines)
- **simplex algorithm** - finds the optimal solution (one of the many algorithms)
