# C++

- compatible with C
- basic syntax is similar to Java

## Java comparison

- `auto` ~ `var`
- `nullptr` ~ `null`
- `include` ~ `import`

## Features

- initialization
    - `int a = 5;`
    - double brackets - `int a {5}`, `int a[] {1, 2, 3}`

## Containers

- `array` - OO version of built-in array
- `vector` - dynamic array (~ArrayList)

## Snippets

- `!!err` is the same as `!(!err)` which means `err != nullptr`
    - `err` is a pointer
