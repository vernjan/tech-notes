# Merkle tree
- fast and secure verifications of large data structures
- binary tree of hashes
    - leafs point to data blocks
    - non-leaf nodes contain the hash of its child nodes
- usages
    - blockchain
    - recovering from failures - comparing replicated data (and actually detecting the differences)
