# Docker
- **OCI** - Open Container Initiative
    - image and runtime specification
    - implemented by Docker, rkt, not sure about LCX
- process vs. container vs. VM
    - process - poor isolation
    - VM - too heavy
- each container
    - has isolated network interface
    - shares the kernel with the host
    - shares the same file system layers with all containers
- rule of thumb - **one process per container**
- build context - can be reduced with `.dockerignore`
- if a service can **run without privileges**, use `USER` to change to a non-root user
- **Jib** (by Google) - builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon

## Build cache
- `--no-cache` to run a clean build
- `FROM` - cached, SHA is validated against repository
- `ADD`, `COPY` - cached, SHA is validated
- `RUN` - cached, key is the exact command (string)
    - cache busting - uses exact versions, changing a version busts the cache
    - always run `apt-get update && apt-get ...` in a single command, otherwise `apt-get update` is skipped
- if an upper directive is not in cache, then all the following commands are not taken from cache either
    - i.e. a new version of Docker base image (`foo:latest` with new SHA) will run `apt-get ...`

## Multi-stage builds
- separate stages for the application build (might require tooling like compilers and create temporary files)
- only the last stage is preserved, usually just copies the final build from previous stages
- shrinks total size and eliminate potentially dangers tools

## Reproducible builds
- version pinning
    - base image
    - system packages
    - app dependencies
- extreme approach - `python@sha256:89d719142de465e7c80195dff820a0bbbbba49b148fbd97abf4b58889372b5e3`

## Java & Docker
- newer Java - better support
    - understands `docker --cpu 2`
- JVM ergonomics - auto-tuning based on the runtime environment (gc, heap size, compiler)
- **class data sharing** (CDS)
    - re-use class loading outputs - faster startups
    - enabled by default
- `jlink` to create a custom (minimal) JRE
    - `jdeps` to determine required modules
    - use multi-stage builds
